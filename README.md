# frontHwc

This is the front-end repository for the HWC22 project, which allows users to create and compile dot diagrams.

## Installation

1. Run `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies.
2. Clone the backend repository `HWC22` inside a folder called `back`. This means that the `frontHWC` and `back` folders are in the same directory, with the `HWC22` project inside the `back` folder.
3. Create a MongoDB database and add the API URL into a `config.js` file inside the `frontHwc` folder.
4. To start the application, run `node app.js` inside the `frontHWC` folder.
5. Access the website locally on `localhost:3000`, create an account, and sign in.
6. Navigate to the "Create" tab, where you can write a `.wire` file in one text field and a `.input` file in the other text field and compile the dot diagram.
