# HWCFront
frontHwc
This is the front-end repository for the HWC22 project, which allows users to create and compile dot diagrams. To run this project, you must first run npm i to install all necessary dependencies.

Installation
After installing dependencies, clone the backend repository "HWC22" inside a folder called "back". This means that the "frontHWC" and "back" folders are in the same directory, with the "HWC22" project inside the "back" folder.

Next, create a MongoDB database and add the API URL into a config.js file inside the frontHwc folder.

To start the application, run node app.js inside the frontHWC folder. Access the website locally on localhost:3000, create an account, and sign in. Then navigate to the "Create" tab, where you can write a .wire file in one text field and a .input file in the other text field and compile the dot diagram.
